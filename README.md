<h2 align="center"> University Award Calculation System (CLI)</h2>
<p align="center">
This system was designed and developed to be used as a final award calculating application for an University. The end user (In this case the University Administration) can enter marks, students had received during the 3 year study period and the application will decide the final award for the student. This application was developed as the second coursework of Software Development Principles 1 (Semester one). And the application will be displayed on the Command Line Interface.
